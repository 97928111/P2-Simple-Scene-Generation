Using randomness on the leave and the branches each time it reroll.
Base on the image, each tree have its own shape, but it is hard to

The logic and reason for the reaction is to let the player who is playing

Artist statement: The effect that I trying to achieve is the tree will also move
with the mouse, but I really do not know how it work and how the code to implied,
so I change to focus on putting in more tree in the scene to make it more real.
